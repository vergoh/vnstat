.TH VNSTAT.CONF 5 "FEBRUARY 2017" "version 1.17" "User Manuals"
.SH NAME

vnstat.conf \- vnStat configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B /etc/vnstat.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR vnstat (1),
.BR vnstati (1)
and
.BR vnstatd (1)
all use the same configuration file for configuration related settings.
Some of the settings are common for all three programs. The file
consists of keyword-argument pairs, one per line. Empty lines and
lines starting with\ '#\' are interpreted as comments and not processed.
Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order
to represent arguments containing spaces. Arguments can be padded
with spaces or tabulator characters. A hardcoded default value
will be used if a keyword can't be found from the configuration file.
.PP
The configuration file is divided into three sections based on the
usage of each keyword. The first section contains keywords that are
considered generic for all commands, the second section is for
daemon related keywords and the last section is for image output.

.SH COMMON KEYWORDS

.TP
.B BandwidthDetection
Try to automatically detect
.B MaxBandwidth
value for each monitored interface. Mostly only ethernet interfaces support
this feature.
.B MaxBandwidth
or interface specific
.B MaxBW
will be used as fallback value if detection fails.
1 = enabled, 0 = disabled. (vnstat and vnstatd only)

.TP
.B BootVariation
Time in seconds how much the boot time reported by system kernel can variate
between updates. Value range: 0..300

.TP
.B CheckDiskSpace
Enable or disable the availability check of at least some free disk space before
a database write. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

.TP
.B DatabaseDir
Specifies the directory where interface databases are to be stored.
A full path must be given and a leading '/' isn't required.

.TP
.B "DayFormat, MonthFormat, TopFormat"
Formatting of date in available outputs. Uses the same format as
.BR date (1).
(vnstat and vnstati only)

.TP
.B Interface
Default interface used when no other interface is specified on
the command line. (vnstat and vnstati only)

.TP
.B Locale
Locale setting to be used for prints. This replaces the LC_ALL
environment variable. Set to "-" or leave empty in order to use the
system default value. (vnstat and vnstati only)

.TP
.B MaxBandwidth
Maximum bandwidth for all interfaces. If the interface specific traffic
exceeds the given value then the data is assumed to be invalid and rejected.
Set to 0 in order to disable the feature. Value range: 0..50000
(vnstat and vnstatd only)

.TP
.B MaxBW
Same as MaxBandwidth but can be used for setting individual limits
for selected interfaces. The name of the interface is specified directly
after the MaxBW keyword without spaces. For example MaxBWeth0 for eth0
and MaxBWppp0 for ppp0. Value range: 0..50000 (vnstat and vnstatd only)

.TP
.B MonthRotate
Day of month that months are expected to change. Usually set to
1 but can be set to alternative values for example for tracking
monthly billed traffic where the billing period doesn't start on
the first day. Value range: 1..28 (vnstat and vnstatd only)

.TP
.B OutputStyle
Modify the content and style of text outputs. 0 = minimal and
narrow output for terminal with limited width, 1 = normal output with
bar column visible, 2 = same as 1 except rate is visible in summary
and weekly outputs, 3 = rate column is visible in all outputs where it
is supported. (vnstat and vnstati only)

Default query mode when no parameters are given. 0 = normal, 1 = days,
2 = months, 3 = top10, 4 = exportdb, 5 = short, 6 = weeks, 7 = hours and
8 = xml. (vnstat only)

.TP
.B RateUnit
Select which unit is used when traffic rate is visible. 0 = bytes, 1 = bits.

.TP
.B RateUnitMode
Select used prefix when traffic rate is visible in bits per second.
0 = IEC binary prefixes (Kibit/s...), 1 = SI decimal prefixes (kbit/s...).
(vnstat and vnstati only)

.TP
.B "RXCharacter, TXCharacter"
Character used for representing the percentual share of received
and transmitted traffic in daily output. (vnstat only)

.TP
.B "RXHourCharacter, TXHourCharacter"
Character used for representing the percentual share of received
and transmitted traffic in hourly output. (vnstat only)

.TP
.B Sampletime
Defines how many seconds the \-tr option will sample traffic.
Value range: 2..600 (vnstat only)

.TP
.B TrafficlessDays
Log days without any traffic to daily list. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.
(vnstat and vnstatd only)

.TP
.B UnitMode
Select how units are prefixed. This will option changes only the prefix,
not how traffic is calculated. 0 = IEC standard prefixes
(KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB), 1 = old style binary prefixes (KB/MB/GB/TB).
(vnstat and vnstati only)

.TP
.B UseFileLocking
Enable or disable the use of file locking during database access. Disabling
file locking may cause database corruption if several processes are trying
to write to the file at the same time.

.SH DAEMON RELATED KEYWORDS

.TP
.B BandwidthDetectionInterval
How often in minutes interface specific detection of
.B MaxBandwidth
is done for detecting possible changes when
.B BandwidthDetection
is enabled. Can be disabled by setting to 0. Value range: 0..30

.TP
.B CreateDirs
Enable or disable the creation of directories when a configured path doesn't
exist. This includes
.B DatabaseDir
,
.B LogFile
and
.B PidFile
directories. The
.B LogFile
directory will be created only when
.B UseLogging
has been set to 1. The
.B PidFile
directory will be created only if the daemon is started as a background process.
The daemon process will try to create the directory using permissions of the
user used to start the process.

.TP
.B DaemonGroup
Specify the user to which the daemon process will switch during startup.
The user can either be the name of the group or a numerical group id.
Leave empty to disable the group switch. This option can only be used when
the process is started as root.

.TP
.B DaemonUser
Specify the user to which the daemon process will switch during startup.
The user can either be the login of the user or a numerical user id.
Leave empty to disable the user switch. This option can only be used when
the process is started as root.

.TP
.B LogFile
Specify log file path and name to be used if UseLogging is set to 1.

.TP

interfaces are offline. Value range:

offline or comes online. 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled.

.TP
.B UpdateFileOwner
Enable or disable the update of file ownership during daemon process startup
or during manual creation of new databases. During daemon startup, only database,
log and pid files will be modified if the user or group change feature (
.B DaemonUser
or
.B DaemonGroup
) is enabled and the files don't match the requested user or group. During manual
database creation, this option will cause file ownership to be inherited from the
database directory if the directory already exists. This option only has effect
when the process is started as root or via sudo.

.TP
.B UpdateInterval
How often in seconds the interface data is updated. Value range:
.BR PollInterval "..300"
