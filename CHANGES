2.12 / 21-Jan-2024

 - Fixed
   - QueryMode documentation in configuration file didn't match implementation
     or man page description
   - Daemon didn't try to import legacy databases when --noadd was used and no
     current version database initially existed resulting in the process
     exiting even when something could have been done
   - Daemon didn't try to import legacy databases when --initdb was used and
     no current version database initially existed, this behaviour can still
     be enabled by using --noadd in combination with --initdb
   - Using --nodaemon and --initdb at the same time didn't result in an error
     being shown
 - New
   - Add 95th percentile output as --95th, also available via --alert, --json,
     --xml and image output, requires 5MinuteHours configuration to be set to
     at least 744 for storing all the necessary data
   - Add --json support for --alert
   - Database queries resulting in error exit with status 1
   - Show spinning animation at the beginning of -l / --live output line,

     interfaces from database that aren't currently visible and haven't seen
     any traffic
   - Add third mode option to --iflist and --dbiflist for getting only the
     interface count as output


2.11 / 19-Aug-2023

 - Fixed
   - Database queries worked only if SQLite double-quoted string (DQS)
     feature (https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html#dblquote) was enabled
   - Disabling data resolutions in data retention configuration didn't result
     in possibly existing database entries getting removed from the database
   - Disabling data resolutions in data retention configuration didn't result
     in the data resolution getting disabled but instead storing data forever
   - "expr: syntax error" during configure in BSD (pull request by namtsui)
   - Image output summary would show only "no data available" text in case of
     zero total traffic even when the historical data of no traffic could have
     been shown instead
   - Image output "-o -" content could get corrupted due to info, warning and
     error messages also using stdout, configuration file warnings being the
     most likely source, now uses stderr in image output
   - Configuration validation was too heavily limiting and enforcing image
     output 5 minute graph related configuration options for combinations that
     would have resulted in usable images
 - New
   - Database cleanup has been changed to interpret data retention
     configuration as number of entries to be kept instead of calendar time,
     this restores the behaviour to similar as it was up to version 1.18, the
     difference is visible only on systems that aren't powered all the time
   - Database is vacuumed during daemon startup and reload, behaviour is
     configurable using VacuumOnStartup and VacuumOnHUPSignal configuration
     options
   - Add configuration option InterfaceOrder for controlling the interface
     order in outputs with multiple interfaces
   - Used data retention configuration is made visible during daemon startup
     and after configuration reloads
   - Daemon will no longer start if all data resolutions have been disabled
     in the configuration file
   - SQLite version is visible in --version outputs
 - Notes
   - "Not enough data available yet." message has been replaced with
     "No data. Timestamp of last update is same YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS as of
     database creation." to better explain the reason why there's nothing to
     show, this message is expected to disappear within configured
     SaveInterval if the interface is active


2.10 / 22-Oct-2022

 - Fixed
   - BandwidthDetection in BSD wasn't correctly converting kernel reported
     bits per second values to Mbits per second resulting in a sanity check
     being triggered and detected values not being used expect for PPPoE
     interfaces which incorrectly were detected as 64000 Mbit
   - Image output of 5 minute graph wasn't possible if data retention of the
     5 minute time period was configured as unlimited
     (pull request by Sebastian Lechte)
   - Estimates and average rates weren't calculated correctly for daily,
     monthly and yearly time periods when monitoring of the interface had been
     started during the ongoing time period
   - Estimates weren't being shown in summary output when OutputStyle or
     --style was configured with a value less than 2 (vnstat)
   - Alignment of column header in short output wasn't correct when
     OutputStyle or --style was configured with the value 0 (vnstat)
 - New
   - Support input of more than 31 characters in interface name when using
     interface1+interface2 syntax data merge queries
   - Support passing --config option multiple times, later files override
     earlier files if settings overlap (vnstat and vnstati)
   - Add configuration option EstimateVisible for controlling the visibility
     of the estimate line
   - Add configuration option EstimateText for modifying the default
     "estimated" text string when the estimate line is visible

     configuration file resulting in the feature always being enabled
   - Hourly graph image output using large fonts didn't correctly fade out
     the x-axis line for hours not having data available
 - New
   - Add --alert for producing output and/or specific exit status when
     configured condition and transfer limit is exceeded, can also be used
     for "quota remaining" type of queries depending on used parameters
   - Add configuration option InterfaceMatchMethod which allows configuring
     the possibility of specifying an interface for database queries by using
     its alias instead of system provided interface name, enabled by default
     to support case insensitive matching of the beginning of interface
     aliases (vnstat and vnstati)
   - Image output file extension allows selecting the used image file format
     as long as the used LibGD supports it, PNG is no longer the only option
   - Add configuration option HourlyGraphMode for changing the output mode
     of the graph, 0 = 24 hour sliding window (default, as in previous
     releases), 1 = graph begins from midnight
   - Add mode parameter for -hg / --hoursgraph options for overriding the
     HourlyGraphMode configuration option setting from the command line
   - Add vertical line to image output hourly graph to visualize midnight
   - Add -t / --timestamp options to daemon for enabling timestamps to prints
     when the daemon is running in the foreground attached to a terminal
   - Accept ; as comment character in configuration file in addition to #
   - Comment out keywords which are using default values with ; character in
     provided configuration file and --showconfig output


2.8 / 4-Sep-2021

 - Fixed
   - Using a combination of --live and --json wasn't flushing stdout after
     each line resulting in buffered output if the output was being piped
   - Image output would fail to show the last line bar graph in list outputs
     if EstimateStyle was 0, BarColumnShowsRate was 1 and the last line had a
     higher traffic rate than other lines
   - Image output didn't correctly horizontally align the "no data available"
     message in 5 minute graph depending on the width of the image
   - Image output related configuration warnings could get shown when image
     output wasn't being used
   - Warnings of mismatches between image output and data retention
     configuration didn't provide relevant details for solving the issues
   - BandwidthDetection was being used for tun interfaces even when the
     Linux kernel had the information hardcoded to 10 Mbit regardless of the
     used real interface, interface specific MaxBW will now be used instead
     or MaxBandwidth as fallback
   - Configured interface specific MaxBW values were getting overridden by
     BandwidthDetection when something could be detected
   - Image output horizontal rx/tx bars often had one pixel too much width in
     the tx section resulting in slightly wrong ratio getting shown
   - Top days list wasn't always sorting entries with exactly the same traffic
     sum using ascending date
   - 64bitInterfaceCounters with value -2 always assumed 32-bit on Linux
     systems until a 64-bit value was seen if kernel headers weren't available
     when binaries were built
 - New
   - Add the possibility of specifying an interface without using the
     -i / --iface options (vnstat and vnstati)
   - The daemon can discover added interfaces from the database without
     requiring a restart, configurable with option RescanDatabaseOnSave
   - Add configuration option UseUTC for using UTC as timezone for database
     entries instead of following the system timezone configuration
   - --iflist uses user configured interface specific MaxBW values in the
     output when available instead of showing only the kernel provided
     information when detected
   - Add configuration option AlwaysAddNewInterfaces to expose the daemon
     --alwaysadd command line option which gains an optional mode parameter
   - Image output uses LibGD filled arc bug workaround only for LibGD
     versions that are known to be broken
   - Image output example cgi (examples/vnstat.cgi) improvements
     - Automatically lists all monitored interfaces instead of requiring the
       list to be filled manually, server name in page title comes from
       hostname command by default
     - Provides links for most available images to more detailed or longer
       versions of each image
     - Allows direct interface specific page access with /interfacename suffix
       for the cgi if the used httpd supports PATH_INFO
     - Page auto refresh can be enabled with configurable interval


2.7 / 16-May-2021

 - Fixed
   - Possibility of segmentation fault with image list output when database
     existed but no data was available
   - ./configure output could show invalid install paths with some parameter
     combinations (pull request by Severin Glöckner)
   - Columns in text hours graph output could get misaligned if the selected
     system locale used a UTF-8 sequence for the thousands separator instead
     of a single character
 - New
   - Add -5g / --fivegraph options to image output with sizing related
     parameters for the output of a 5 minute resolution bar graph

   - Allow writing image output to a filename starting with -
   - Add --initdb to daemon for creating a new empty database without having
     the daemon process staying running, doesn't discard data if a database
     already exists
   - Add configuration option BarColumnShowsRate for having the bar column in
     image list outputs be scaled according to the average rate column values
     when those values are visible, disabled by default
   - Add --dbiflist for getting a list of interfaces in the database, both
     --iflist and --dbiflist also get alternative more parseable outputs
   - Add configuration option for large font output and make 5 minute
     resolution graph visible in vnstat.cgi


2.6 / 20-Jan-2020

 - Fixed
   - --json and --xml didn't support having both mode and limit parameters
     defined at the same time as documented, broken since previous release
   - Documentation was using a mix of "count" and "limit" for the option of
     limiting the maximum number of shown entries in queries
   - Summary image output would segmentation fault when the database existed
     but didn't yet contain any daily or monthly data for the selected
     interface

2.5 / 14-Jan-2020

 - Fixed
   - Automatic interface selection wasn't done for --traffic and --live when
     the Interface configuration setting was left empty
   - --setalias didn't do anything when used in combination with --add
   - -l / --live and -tr default to first interface instead of producing an
     error if a interface merge is requested


2.4 / 18-Aug-2019

 - Fixed
   - Daemon didn't correctly wait when acquiring database lock for data write
     which could result in unnecessary errors and even process exit if an
     external database read operation had exactly the same timing as the
     daemon write operation
   - Daemon didn't fork() even when requested to with --daemon when started
     by PID 1 (issue seen at least in Docker containers)
   - Move vnstatd man page from section 1 to section 8
 - New
   - Add --rename for renaming interfaces already existing the database


2.3 / 10-Jul-2019

     if the used systemd version supported ProtectSystem=strict but didn't
     support StateDirectory (issue seen at least with systemd 232 in Debian 9)
   - Debian and Red Hat init.d example files had wrong path for the pid file
   - Interfaces could end up staying marked as 'disabled' in the database even
     after becoming back active and monitored, only the shown status was wrong
     without resulting in any data loss
   - Some image outputs didn't allocate enough height for the image resulting
     in the last row having less space below it than intended
 - New
   - Automatic interface selection when the Interface configuration setting
     is left empty (new default)
   - Add configuration option DatabaseWriteAheadLogging to enable SQLite
     Write-Ahead Logging mode which may provide some disk i/o benefits,

     setting of the "synchronous" flag, see
     https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous for more details
   - Show warning in log if writing cached data to database is slow
   - Try database query for up to 5 seconds when database is busy or locked
     instead of giving up immediately
   - Continue daemon process execution with data caching if database writes
     fail due to disk being full

     found to be too high compared to the value of MaxBandwidth
 - Notes
   - Added clarification to the man page that the 'jsonversion' and
     'xmlversion' fields in the --json and --xml outputs should be seen as
     the API version and compared to the previously used version in 3rd party
     implementations for verifying compatibility
   - Default value of UpdateInterval is now 20 instead of previous 30 seconds


2.1 / 6-Dec-2018

   - No proper error message was produced when querying interface which didn't
     exist in the database
   - Several typos and spelling mistakes in documentation
   - Daemon:waittimesync_does_not_wait_with_new_interfaces test was failing if

 - Increased accuracy of monthly estimate calculation
 - Traffic rates can be made visible and the shown unit is configurable
   as bits or bytes
 - New summary layout in image output
 - Image output can have the background color set as transparent
 - Possibility to merge data from several interfaces to one output with
   interface1+interface2 syntax
 - -s / --sync parameter added to daemon
 - --dbdir and --locale parameters added
 - Outputs now use system locale by default and formatting of dates follow
   the locale setting unless configured otherwise

 - Fix: Unreadable configuration file doesn't cause a segmentation fault
 - Fix: /proc/net/dev parser didn't see the difference between eth10 and eth1
 - Fix: Updating a database from two of more processes at the same time
   was able to sometimes cause data loss
 - Fix: Estimates are calculated based on last database update
 - Fix: Each interface update had a possibility of losing 1023 bytes of
   traffic at most due to improper rounding
   (Thanks to Michael Berlin for suggesting a suitable correction)

 - Adaptive units (kB, MB, GB, TB)
 - Possibility to sync counters without counting traffic
 - Maximum bandwidth of interfaces can be set


1.4 / 26-Mar-2004

 - Fix: major output problems when compiled with some compilers
