Compiling the binaries
::::::::::::::::::::::

 This source package contains the required source files for vnStat including
 the daemon (vnstatd) and image output (vnstati). Executing

     ./configure && make

 will compile 'vnstat' and 'vnstatd' without requiring additional libraries.
 The optional image output capable binary 'vnstati' will also be compiled if
 the required additional libgd2 library is found to be available. In
 BSD ports libgd2 is usually named simply 'gd'. Executing

 An example cgi ('vnstat.cgi') to be used with http server with the image
 output support has been provided in the 'examples' directory. Configuration
 options for the cgi are in the beginning of the file.

 Some BSD users may need to provide correct LIBRARY_PATH and CPATH to the
 configure script if the image output is wanted but the location of libgd2
 isn't automatically detected.


Installing as root
::::::::::::::::::

 Login as root and run the following command:

     make install

 If there were no errors, vnStat binaries, man pages and a config file
 should now be installed. The configuration file will be upgraded using
 previously configured values if it is found already to exist.

 The configuration file /usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf should also be checked
 at this point. See the vnstat.conf man page for documentation about available
 options.

 Finally make vnStat monitor the selected interface(s). Configure init
 scripts so that the following command is executed once during system
 start:

     vnstatd -d

 One suitable place is for example /etc/rc.local.

 During first startup, the daemon (vnstatd) should list and add all
 available interfaces for monitoring. Depending on configuration, it may
 take some minutes for the 'vnstat' command to begin showing results.
 Monitoring of unwanted interfaces can be stopped with:

     vnstat --delete -i ethunwanted


Installing without root access
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 Copy all needed binaries to some directory included in your PATH
 (~/bin/ is an example) and make the database directory.

     cp src/vnstat src/vnstatd src/vnstati ~/bin/
     cp cfg/vnstat.conf ~/.vnstatrc
     mkdir ~/.vnstat

 Next open the config file ~/.vnstatrc with your favorite text editor and
 locate the following line:

     DatabaseDir "/var/lib/vnstat"

 and replace it with

     DatabaseDir "/pathtomyhomedir/.vnstat"

 and save the file. If you are unsure about your home directory path, execute

     cd ; pwd

 The ouput should tell your home directory.

 Now it's time to add a crontab entry for vnStat. Do that by executing the
 command 'crontab -e' and add the following line (without leading spaces,
 remember to change the path):

     @reboot ~/bin/vnstatd -d

 If you found yourself using a strange editor then 'man vi' should help.

 Make sure the configuration file (~/.vnstatrc) has the log option either
 disabled or set to a file that is located in a place where you have write
 permissions, such as your home dir. Then try starting the daemon with

     vnstat -d

 After that wait for (or generate) at least 1024 bytes of network traffic
 (and 5 min for the next database file save).

     vnstat

 Now you should get some stats about your network usage. See the config
 file ~/.vnstatrc for interface and other settings.
