Compiling the binaries
::::::::::::::::::::::

 This source package contains the required source files for vnStat including
 the daemon (vnstatd) and image output (vnstati). Executing

     ./configure && make

 will compile 'vnstat' and 'vnstatd' without requiring additional libraries.
 The optional image output capable binary 'vnstati' will also be compiled if
 the required additional libgd2 library is found to be available. In
 BSD ports libgd2 is usually 'graphics/gd'.

 An example cgi ('vnstat.cgi') to be used with a http server with the image
 output support has been provided in the 'examples' directory. Configuration
 options for the cgi are in the beginning of the file. Additional examples
 for using the json output are also available in the same directory.

 Some BSD users may need to provide correct CFLAGS and LDFLAGS paths to the
 configure script if the image output is wanted but the location of libgd2
 isn't automatically detected. For example (using bash as shell):

     CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" ./configure

 For executing the optional test suite, see the appendix at the end of this
 file.


Installing as root
::::::::::::::::::

 Login as root and run the following command:

     make install

 If there were no errors, vnStat binaries, man pages and a configuration
 file should now be installed. The configuration file will be upgraded using
 previously configured values if it is found already to exist.

 The configuration file /usr/local/etc/vnstat.conf should be checked at
 this point. See the vnstat.conf man page for documentation about available
 options.

 Finally make vnStat monitor the selected interface(s). Configure init
 scripts so that the following command is executed once during system
 startup:

     /usr/local/sbin/vnstatd -d

 One suitable place is for example /etc/rc.local.

 During first startup, the daemon (vnstatd) should list and add all
 available interfaces for monitoring. The command can also be executed
 manually at this point in order to avoid having to reboot the system
 Depending on configuration, it may take some minutes for the 'vnstat'
 command to begin showing results. Monitoring of unwanted interfaces
 can be stopped with:

     vnstat --delete -i ethunwanted


Installing without root access
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 Copy all needed binaries to some directory included in your PATH
 (~/bin/ is an example) and create the database directory.

     cp -v vnstat vnstatd vnstati ~/bin/
     cp -v cfg/vnstat.conf ~/.vnstatrc
     mkdir ~/.vnstat

 Next open the configuration file ~/.vnstatrc with your favorite text editor
 and locate the following line:

     DatabaseDir "/var/lib/vnstat"

 and replace it with

     DatabaseDir "/pathtomyhomedir/.vnstat"

 and save the file. If you are unsure about your home directory path, execute

     cd ; pwd

 The ouput should tell your home directory.

 Now it's time to add a crontab entry for vnStat. Do that by executing the
 command 'crontab -e' and add the following line (without leading spaces,
 remember to change the path):

     @reboot ~/bin/vnstatd -d

 If you found yourself using a strange editor then 'man vi' may help.

 Make sure the configuration file (~/.vnstatrc) has the log option either
 disabled or set to a file that is located in a place where you have write
 permissions, such as your home dir. Then try starting the daemon with

     vnstatd -d

 After that wait for (or generate) at least 1024 bytes of network traffic
 (and 5 min for the next database file save).

     vnstat

 Now you should get some stats about your network usage. See the config
 file ~/.vnstatrc for interface and other settings.


Appendix: Running the test suite
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 This step isn't mandatory for using vnStat.

 The source package includes a test suite for validating at least some of the
 functionalities provided by the executables. The test suite requires the
 Check unit testing framework ( https://libcheck.github.io/check/ ) to
 be installed and available (usually 'devel/check' in ports). The configure
 script also assumes that the 'pkg-config' command is installed. That command
 is usually part of the 'devel/pkgconf' package. After the configure script has
 been executed the test suite can be executed with:

     make check

 The output should show a non-zero number of tests executed if all the
 necessary packages were available. A more detailed list of executed tests
 can be seen from the check_vnstat.log file after execution.
