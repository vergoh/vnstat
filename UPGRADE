(Updated 29.2.2004 based on version 1.3)

This file will try to explain how vnStat is supposed to be upgraded 
from version 1.0. The makefile should handle upgrades from version 1.1
to 1.3 without user interaction. But for those still using 1.0, please
read the instructions once before executing step by step.

But once again to make this clear:

 The following instructions apply only for those upgrading from
 version 1.0. Any other version can be upgraded by the Makefile itself.


What to do before installing?
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 Make a backup of your current database. For the old multiuser install that
 would be /var/spool/vnstat/db and for singleuser it's ~/.vnstatdb
 Copy that file to some other directory that isn't in any relation with
 vnStat. All this is only for backup so the file can be removed once
 1.3 has been installed and working.

 The next thing is to rename that database according to the interface it's
 monitoring. Here's an example if the interface would be eth0.

     mv /var/spool/vnstat/db /var/spool/vnstat/eth0

 If there are multiple databases that where used with the -f parameter then
 repeat that procedure for each of of them. In a similar way those using
 the singleuser version would first make a directory labelled '~/.vnstat'
 and move the old database there.

     mv ~/.vnstatdb ~/.vnstat/eth0

 Now your all set to continue the install process like the INSTALL file
 tells. Remember that there's no need to uninstall version 1.0 before
 installing 1.3.
