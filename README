What is vnStat
::::::::::::::

 In short, vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the
 /proc filesystem to get the needed information. This means that vnStat
 won't actually be sniffing any traffic. 

 See the webpage for few 'screenshots'.


Getting started
:::::::::::::::

 First you should install vnStat. See the INSTALL file, it contains all needed
 information for the installing process. Users of version 1.0 should see the 
 UPGRADE file first.


Available options
:::::::::::::::::

 A list of commonly used options is available with 'vnstat --help'. The
 complete list can be accessed with 'vnstat --longhelp'. See the man(1)
 page for option explanations.


Usage tips
::::::::::

 Most vnStat settings can be changed from the config file. The config
 file is either ~/.vnstatrc or /etc/vnstat.conf depending which one is
 found first. A new config file can be generated using current settings
 with the following command:

    vnstat --showconfig >newconfig

 The config file contains comments before any settings describing with
 the purpose and usage of each setting is.

 By default vnStat will use dd.mm.yy format in timestamps. For example
 this can be changed from the config file by locating lines

DayFormat    "%d.%m."
MonthFormat  "%b '%y"
TopFormat    "%d.%m.%y"

 and replacing the parameters:

DayFormat    "%m/%d"
MonthFormat  "%b '%y"
TopFormat    "%%m/%d/%y"

 Note that some field have space limits and giving too long parameters
 might affect the readability of the output. Changing date formats won't
 affect the database(s) in any way.
